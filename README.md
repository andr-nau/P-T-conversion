# P-T-conversion
Finding of conversion formula for recalculation of probability (P) into the temperature (T).

As an input, there are set of measured s-type curves for different temperatures (e.g. 350mK - 800K each 5mK)

After two intermediate steps:

![Step2](https://github.com/andr-nau/s-curves-coef/blob/master/Fig3_Step2.gif "Step2")

As an output we have conversion curve (dots) and formula (red line) - polynome of 3rd order A+B*x+C*x^2+D*x^3:
